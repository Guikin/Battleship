## How to play

1. Drag and drop your ship on the "PlayerGrid" and press Play
2. The game starts with the players turn so you can click on any grid in the "Maverick Zone"
3. The goal is to destroy all your opponent's ships before they destroy yours
4. Once all ships are destroyed on either side the game is over and you can replay again.
